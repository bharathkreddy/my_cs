# Project 3: File System Explorer (Binary Trees)

## Core Concept

Build a file system navigator that organizes files and folders using various binary tree structures, with search, organization, and metadata management capabilities.

## Key Features \& Operations

- **Directory Structure**: Binary search tree for alphabetical organization
- **File Search**: BST operations for fast file lookup
- **Size Analysis**: Heap-based trees for largest/smallest files
- **Recent Files**: Balanced trees (AVL/Red-Black) for access history
- **File Indexing**: Binary trees for content-based search
- **Backup System**: Tree serialization and reconstruction
- **Duplicate Detection**: Tree comparison algorithms


## Real-World Applications

- Database indexing systems
- Compiler symbol tables
- Decision-making algorithms
- Huffman coding for compression
- Game AI decision trees


## Operations Covered

- **Insertion/Deletion**: Adding and removing files/folders
- **Tree Traversal**: In-order, pre-order, post-order navigation
- **Search Operations**: Finding files by name, size, date
- **Tree Balancing**: AVL rotations, red-black tree maintenance
- **Tree Serialization**: Save/load entire directory structures
- **Tree Comparison**: Backup verification and sync operations
- **Height Calculation**: Analyzing directory depth
- **Leaf Operations**: Finding empty folders or isolated files
