# Project 1: Web Browser Simulation (Stacks)

## Core Concept

Build a simplified web browser that manages navigation history, bookmarks, and tab management using various stack implementations.

## Key Features \& Operations

- **Navigation History**: Back/Forward buttons using dual stacks
- **Bookmark Management**: Nested folder structure using stacks
- **Tab Management**: Stack-based tab switching and restoration
- **Undo/Redo System**: For bookmark edits and tab operations
- **Session Restore**: Save/load browsing sessions


## Real-World Applications

- Browser history navigation
- Function call management in programming languages
- Expression evaluation and syntax parsing
- Memory management (call stacks)


## Operations Covered

- Push/Pop operations
- Peek/Top operations
- Stack overflow handling
- Multiple stack coordination
- Stack persistence (save/load)
