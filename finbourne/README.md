## Best Practices Learned

### Design Principles

1. **Context Engineering:** Most critical skill - provide right context to agents
2. **Start Simple:** Begin with single agents, add complexity gradually
3. **Evaluation-Driven:** Build systematic testing from day one
4. **Security First:** Especially critical in financial services
5. **Cost-Conscious:** Monitor and optimize API costs continuously
6. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Critical decisions need human approval
7. **Error Recovery:** Plan for failures, implement robust retry logic
8. **Observability:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring essential

### When to Use Each Framework

**CrewAI:**
- Quick prototyping needed
- Role-based team collaboration
- Simple sequential workflows
- Marketing/content use cases
- Fastest time to value

**AutoGen:**
- Conversation-based coordination
- Need code execution
- Event-driven architecture
- Microsoft ecosystem integration
- Research and analysis workflows

**LangGraph:**
- Complex stateful workflows
- Production-grade requirements
- Need fine-grained control
- Cyclical reasoning patterns
- Enterprise deployment
- **Recommended for LUSID integration**
